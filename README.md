# chicken_diseases_classification

### Introduction:
Poultry farming is a vital industry worldwide, providing a major source of food production. The health of chickens is paramount in maintaining this industry's sustainability. An essential aspect of chicken health is to accurately and efficiently identify whether a chicken is healthy or not.

### Problem Statement:
The challenge at hand is to develop a deep learning model that can reliably and swiftly distinguish healthy chickens from those with health issues. Such a model can have a significant impact on the poultry industry by enabling early intervention and improving overall animal welfare. This project aims to address this issue and contribute to the field of poultry health monitoring through the application of deep learning techniques.
